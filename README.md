The task focused on developing a detailed and well-structured 30-day social media content calendar for the brand CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS PVT.LTD. The primary goal was to enhance the brandâ€™s digital presence by planning consistent and engaging content tailored to its target audience. The calendar was designed to include a diverse mix of post types such as promotional content highlighting specific products or offers, informative posts aimed at educating the audience, behind-the-scenes glimpses to build brand transparency, customer testimonials to boost credibility, as well as interactive posts like polls, Q&As, and contests to drive audience engagement. Each day in the calendar features a specific content theme, along with suggested captions, optimal posting times based on engagement trends, and a curated list of relevant hashtags to improve discoverability and reach. Where applicable, the platform focus (e.g., Instagram, Facebook) is also indicated to align content with platform-specific trends and formats.
